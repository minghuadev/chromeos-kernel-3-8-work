Exynos5 PPMU driver
-------------------

Performance events are primitive values used to get performance data. These
events provide information about the behavior of the SoC that can be used
when analyzing system performance. These events are made visible using the
PPMU logic.
Exynos5 PPMU driver is used by the exynos5 devfreq driver to control the bus
frequency/voltage.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
	* samsung,exynos5-ppmu - for exynos5250 type ppmu.
- reg:
	* physical base address of the Right PPMU and length of memory mapped
	region

Example:
--------

	ppmu {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-ppmu";
		reg = <0x13660000 0x2000>;
	};
