Device-Tree bindings for drm hdmi driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one among the following:
	1) "samsung,exynos4210-hdmi"
	2) "samsung,exynos4212-hdmi"
	3) "samsung,exynos5420-hdmi"
- reg: physical base address of hdmi block and length
	of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- hpd-gpio: following information about the hotplug gpio pin.
	a) phandle of the gpio controller node.
	b) pin number within the gpio controller.
	c) pin function mode.
	d) optional flags and pull up/down.
	e) drive strength.
- clocks: list of clock IDs from SoC clock driver.
	a) hdmi: It is required for gate operation on aclk_200_disp1 clock
		which clocks the display1 block.
	b) sclk_hdmi: It is required for gate operation on sclk_hdmi clock
		which clocks hdmi IP.
	c) sclk_pixel: Parent for mux mout_hdmi.
	d) sclk_hdmiphy: Parent for mux mout_hdmi.
	e) mout_hdmi: It is required by the driver to switch between the 2
		parents i.e. sclk_pixel and sclk_hdmiphy. If hdmiphy is stable
		after configuration, parent is set to sclk_hdmiphy else
		sclk_pixel.
- clock-names: aliases as per driver requirements for above clock IDs:
	"hdmi", "sclk_hdmi", "sclk_pixel", "sclk_hdmiphy" and "mout_hdmi".
- phy-power-control child node: it is required to control the power to hdmiphy.
	It should provide the following information:
	- reg : base physical address and size of phy control registers
- hdmiphy child node: it is a optional node required for SoCs in which hdmiphy
	is mapped to the platform bus. It is required to map the phy registers
	and configure them for given resolution. This node should provide the
	following information:
        - reg : base physical address and size of hdmiphy configuration
		registers

Example:

	hdmi {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4212-hdmi";
		reg = <0x14530000 0x100000>;
		interrupts = <0 95 0>;
		hpd-gpio = <&gpx3 7 0xf 1 3>;
		clocks = <&clock 344>, <&clock 136>, <&clock 137>,
				<&clock 157>, <&clock 1024>;
		clock-names = "hdmi", "sclk_hdmi", "sclk_pixel",
				"sclk_hdmiphy", "mout_hdmi";
	};
