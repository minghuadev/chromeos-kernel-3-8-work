Device-Tree bindings for mixer driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be:
	1) "samsung,exynos4210-mixer"
	2) "samsung,exynos5250-mixer"
	3) "samsung,exynos5420-mixer"
- reg: physical base address of the mixer and length of memory mapped
	region.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- clocks: list of clock IDs from SoC clock driver.
	a) mixer: It is required for gate operation on aclk_200_disp1 clock
		which clocks the display1 block.
	b) sclk_hdmi: Parent for mux mout_mixer.

Example:

	mixer {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-mixer";
		reg = <0x14450000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 343>, <&clock 136>;
		clock-names = "mixer", "sclk_hdmi";
	};
