SAMSUNG USB-PHY controllers

** Samsung's usb 2.0 phy transceiver

The Samsung's usb 2.0 phy transceiver is used for controlling
usb 2.0 phy for s3c-hsotg as well as ehci-s5p and ohci-exynos
usb controllers across Samsung SOCs.
TODO: Adding the PHY binding with controller(s) according to the under
development generic PHY driver.

Required properties:

Exynos4210:
- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos4210-usb2phy"
- reg : base physical address of the phy registers and length of memory mapped
	region.
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
- clock-names: names of clock correseponding IDs clock property as requested
	       by the controller driver.

Exynos5250:
- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos5250-usb2phy"
- reg : base physical address of the phy registers and length of memory mapped
	region.
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
- clock-names: names of clock correseponding IDs clock property as requested
	       by the controller driver.

Exynos5420:
- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos5420-usb2phy"
- reg : base physical address of the phy registers and length of memory mapped
	region.
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
- clock-names: names of clock correseponding IDs clock property as requested
              by the controller driver.

Optional properties:
- #address-cells: should be '1' when usbphy node has a child node with 'reg'
		  property.
- #size-cells: should be '1' when usbphy node has a child node with 'reg'
	       property.
- ranges: allows valid translation between child's address space and parent's
	  address space.

- samsung,hsic-reset-gpio: an active low GPIO pin that resets a device
			   connected to the HSIC port. Useful for things like
			   an on-board SMSC3503 hub.
- pinctrl-0: Pin control group containing the HSIC reset GPIO pin.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

- The child node 'usbphy-sys' to the node 'usbphy' is for the system controller
  interface for usb-phy. It should provide the following information required by
  usb-phy controller to control phy.
  - reg : base physical address of PHY_CONTROL registers.
	  The size of this register is the total sum of size of all PHY_CONTROL
	  registers that the SoC has. For example, the size will be
	  '0x4' in case we have only one PHY_CONTROL register (e.g.
	  OTHERS register in S3C64XX or USB_PHY_CONTROL register in S5PV210)
	  and, '0x8' in case we have two PHY_CONTROL registers (e.g.
	  USBDEVICE_PHY_CONTROL and USBHOST_PHY_CONTROL registers in exynos4x).
	  and so on.

Example:
 - Exynos4210

	usbphy@125B0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-usb2phy";
		reg = <0x125B0000 0x100>;
		ranges;

		clocks = <&clock 2>, <&clock 305>;
		clock-names = "xusbxti", "otg";

		samsung,hsic-reset-gpio = <&gpx2 4 1>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&hsic_reset>;

		usbphy-sys {
			/* USB device and host PHY_CONTROL registers */
			reg = <0x10020704 0x8>;
		};
	};


** Samsung's usb 3.0 phy transceiver

Starting exynso5250, Samsung's SoC have usb 3.0 phy transceiver
which is used for controlling usb 3.0 phy for dwc3-exynos usb 3.0
controllers across Samsung SOCs.

Required properties:

Exynos5250:
- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos5250-usb3phy"
- reg : base physical address of the phy registers and length of memory mapped
	region.
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
- clock-names: names of clocks correseponding to IDs in the clock property
	       as requested by the controller driver.

Exynos5420:
- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos5420-usb3phy"
- reg : base physical address of the phy registers and length of memory mapped
	region.
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
- clock-names: names of clock correseponding IDs clock property as requested
              by the controller driver.

Optional properties:
- #address-cells: should be '1' when usbphy node has a child node with 'reg'
		  property.
- #size-cells: should be '1' when usbphy node has a child node with 'reg'
	       property.
- ranges: allows valid translation between child's address space and parent's
	  address space.

- The child node 'usbphy-sys' to the node 'usbphy' is for the system controller
  interface for usb-phy. It should provide the following information required by
  usb-phy controller to control phy.
  - reg : base physical address of PHY_CONTROL registers.
	  The size of this register is the total sum of size of all PHY_CONTROL
	  registers that the SoC has. For example, the size will be
	  '0x4' in case we have only one PHY_CONTROL register (e.g.
	  OTHERS register in S3C64XX or USB_PHY_CONTROL register in S5PV210)
	  and, '0x8' in case we have two PHY_CONTROL registers (e.g.
	  USBDEVICE_PHY_CONTROL and USBHOST_PHY_CONTROL registers in exynos4x).
	  and so on.

- Aliases: exynos5420 has multiple usb 3.0 phy transceivers interacting with multiple
          dwc3 controllers. So the usb 3.0 phy controller nodes should be represented
          in the aliases node using the following format:
          'usb3phy{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.

- samsung,txpreempamptune: board specific "HS Transmitter Pre-Emphasis Current
			   Control".
			   Allowed values -- (One unit amount is approximately
			   600uA and is defined as 1X preemphasis current).
			     0x0 (default) = pre-emphasis is disabled.
			     0x1 = 1X pre-emphasis current.
			     0x2 = 2X pre-emphasis current.
			     0x3 = 3X pre-emphasis current.

Example:
	usbphy@12100000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-usb3phy";
		reg = <0x12100000 0x100>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		clocks = <&clock 1>, <&clock 286>;
		clock-names = "ext_xtal", "usbdrd30";

		usbphy-sys {
			/* USB device and host PHY_CONTROL registers */
			reg = <0x10040704 0x8>;
		};
	};
