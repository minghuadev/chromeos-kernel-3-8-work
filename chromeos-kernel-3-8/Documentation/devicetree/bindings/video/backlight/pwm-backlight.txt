pwm-backlight bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - one of "brightness-levels" or "max-brightness", described below
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the array
      defined by the "brightness-levels" property or a value between 0 and
      "max-brightness")

Optional properties:
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - max-brightness: Instead of specifying a complete set of brightness
      levels, a single maximum brightness value may be given. This indicates
      that all integers between 0 and max-brightness are valid brightness
      values.
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
               "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0])

Example:

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 5000000>;

		brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <6>;
	};
or:
	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 1000000 0>;

		max-brightness = <1024>;
		default-brightness-level = <700>;
	};
