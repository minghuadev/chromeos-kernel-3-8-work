* Samsung's Watchdog Timer Controller

The Samsung's Watchdog controller is used for resuming system operation
after a preset amount of time during which the WDT reset event has not
occured.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "samsung,s3c2410-wdt"
- reg : base physical address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region and the optional addresses and length of memory mapped regions
	of PMU registers for masking/unmasking WDT.
- interrupts : interrupt number to the cpu.

Optional properties:
- reset-mask-bit: bit number in the PMU registers to program mask/unmask WDT.

Example:

watchdog {
                compatible = "samsung,s3c2410-wdt";
                reg = <0x101D0000 0x100>, <0x10040408 0x4>, <0x1004040c 0x4>;
                interrupts = <0 42 0>;
                clocks = <&clock 316>;
                clock-names = "watchdog";
                status = "disabled";
                reset-mask-bit = <0>;
        };
